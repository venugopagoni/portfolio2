                <h2>An Efficient Privacy-Preserving Credit Score System Based on Non interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof
                </h2>
                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                    <p>The credit system significantly impacts individuals, especially those with poor credit histories,
                     while often neglecting privacy protection, risking sensitive user information leakage.</p>
                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p>This project aims to develop a CSC model that quantifies credit risk while incorporating robust 
                        privacy protection measures through encryption and data anonymization techniques.</p>
                        <h2>Result
                        </h2><p>The anticipated outcome is a secure credit assessment framework that enhances trustworthiness
                             and protects user privacy, benefiting both individuals and financial institutions.

                <h2>A Block chain based autonomus decentralized online social network.</h2>
                <h3>Problem Statement
                </h3><p>Current online social networks face issues of centralization, 
                    leading to privacy concerns and data security risks for users.

                </p>
                <h3>Approach
                </h3>
                <p>This project develops a decentralized OSN service using blockchain technology, 
                    providing secure peer-to-peer interactions with unique identities and private keys, 
                    utilizing Java for the front end and MySQL for the back end.

                </p>
                <h3>Result
                </h3>
                <p>The outcome will be a secure, trustworthy platform that enhances user privacy and transparency, 
                    mitigating data exploitation risks in online social interactions.
